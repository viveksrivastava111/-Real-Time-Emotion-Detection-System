# Real-Time-Emotion-Detection-System

A real-time emotion detection system that uses computer vision and deep learning to identify human emotions from facial expressions using live video streams or webcam input.

## Overview
This project detects and classifies human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, etc., in real time using a webcam. It's built using Python, OpenCV, and a deep learning model trained on facial expression datasets.

### Features
1-Emotion classification using a CNN model. <br>
2-Real-time video stream detection via webcam. <br>
3-Visual feedback with bounding boxes and emotion labels. <br>
4-Option to save video or image snapshots. <br>
5-Lightweight and easy to deploy.<br>


### Tech Stack
##### Language: Python 3.x <br>
##### Libraries: <br>
OpenCV <br>
TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose based on your implementation) <br>
Keras<br>
NumPy <br>
dlib or face_recognition (optional) <br>
#### Model: Pre-trained CNN on FER-2013 or custom-trained model

### Emotion Classes
The system can detect the following emotions (depending on the dataset/model used):

★ Happy 😊 <br>
★ Sad 😢<br>
★ Angry 😠<br>
★ Surprised 😮<br>
★ Neutral 😐<br>
★ Fearful 😨<br>
★ Disgusted 🤢<br>
